# 10.5../16 is a completely open network. Typically I have all dhcp leases added to my ott.cbains.ca zone automagically, and that dns server serves all vlans.
# This leaks (a bit of) information to everyone within radio range, assuming they know, or can guess the hostnames of machines on my network, since they can poke at my network topology and figure out which devices are in what network segments.
# Instead, on this network we continnue to use the nice DNS setup (dhcp registration + dns crypt + monitoring), but we drop any requests that could otherwise reveal network topology.

# I use nat to send all DNS traffic to the network wide resolver, hence the "any" dest.
